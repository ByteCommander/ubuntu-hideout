# The Rules

## Our rules and community guidelines

This is intended as a place where people can chat and enjoy their conversations with other people of the Ubuntu community and anybody else. Therefore most rules are actually implied by "be nice and respectful".

- Do not attack or offend other people. This includes racist and sexist content.
- Do not post spam, advertisements or similar content or links to websites containing it.
- Do not post NSFW content, including erotic and violence.
- Do not annoy people by posting loads of meaningless messages, especially do not repeatedly ping people for no reason.
- Do not use CAPS LOCK.
- We prefer to keep discussions away from topics about which some people might have very strong opinions, like politics and religion, which could lead to severe arguments.


We would also like to recommend you to read the [Ubuntu Code of Conduct](https://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct) as well
